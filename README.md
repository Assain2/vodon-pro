### Synchronising videos

![Setup videos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rodeoclash/vodon-pro/main/screenshots/setup.png)

_Everything starts in Vodon by telling it how to synchronise your videos. Align each video to the same point in time in the match._

### Reviewing videos

_With the videos aligned, the global time control can be used to navigate all videos. Click the videos in the sidebar to instantly jump to that players point of view._

### Drawing on frames

_Vodon Pro even has drawing tools. Use these to annotate the frame that you're talking about it in the review._

## Frequently asked questions

### Why do I get warned about the download?

When you download, you may see one or more warnings about the download being "unsafe". This is due to code signing and while I can pay (about $100AUD) to sign my downloads, I haven't got this in place just yet.

### Why use this over the inbuilt replay tools?

If you're performing VOD reviews on games with inbuilt replay tools then Vodon Pro will be a poor substitute for those tools... use them instead! That said, not all games support replay files or allow you to easily find and share them.

Finally, if you're studying a game by a competing team, you may only have access to video replays or streams of their games (nothing stops you from using Vodon Pro on your competitors)
