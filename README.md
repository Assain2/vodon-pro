Vodon Pro is a **synchronised**, desktop video player for esport "VOD" reviews.

Add viewpoints from each of the players in a match, tell Vodon how to synchronise the videos then use its video playback with the ability to instantly jump to any of the viewpoints to review your game.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why do I get warned about the download?

When you download, you may see one or more warnings about the download being "unsafe". This is due to code signing and while I can pay (about $100AUD) to sign my downloads, I haven't got this in place just yet.

### Why use this over the inbuilt replay tools?

If you're performing VOD reviews on games with inbuilt replay tools then Vodon Pro will be a poor substitute for those tools... use them instead! That said, not all games support replay files or allow you to easily find and share them.

Finally, if you're studying a game by a competing team, you may only have access to video replays or streams of their games (nothing stops you from using Vodon Pro on your competitors)
